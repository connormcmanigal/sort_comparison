# DATA260P Project 1: Sorting Algorithm Analysis

## Connor McManigal and Peyton Politewicz 

- Implemented MergeSort, QuickSort, InsertionSort, ShellSort, BucketSort, RadixSort,
- Created BinaryInsertionSort in an effort to improve InsertionSort runtimes and Simple Tim Sort to improve MergeSort runtimes
- Compared time complexity of each on truly random generated arrays and almost sorted generated arrays at sizes 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, and 16000
- Evaluated and compared empirical and theoretical big-O as datasets scaled in size
- Diagnosed runtime ratios, plotted findings, and drew conclusions on our algorithmic performance
